          <h2>Staffing, Safety, and Census Data Triage</h2>
          <p>
			<ul>
				•	Worked closely with former DBHDS Commissioner to develop Staffing, Safety, and Census Structured Approach. Discussing different broad directions of strategical improvement including hiring and staff scheduling, reduction of patient aggression on a unit-by-unit basis, reduction of length of stay based on legal status, managing census and preventing overcrowding, rate of discharging patients, reducing overall bed days, and preventing patient diversions.
			</ul>	
			<ul>
				•	Gathered executive leadership team on monthly basis for the ESH Action Plan Meeting to discuss current trends; properly educating and informing leadership of the status and current direction of the hospital. 
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Data created a revitalized structure of reporting for all of the hospital’s key leadership roles, influencing educated decision making enabling leadership to visualize what is going on around the hospital as a whole.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Sustained awareness of Staffing, Safety, and Census by tailoring Power BI dashboards to directly emphasize these areas of concern. Giving leadership access to live data dashboards.  
			</ul>
		  </p>
        </div>
		
		
		
		<div class="section-title">
          <h2>Medical Records Delinquency Rate Improvement</h2>
          <p>
		  <ul>
				•	Uncovered and organized untouched raw data pertaining to medical record delinquencies for clinical disciplines, deficiency date, hospital location, delinquency type, and other specified details.
			</ul>	
			<ul>
				•	Worked with Health Information Management (HIM) Department to prioritize delinquencies in specific areas, beginning with multiple Performance Improvement Plans including Nursing Forms & Signature Assurance, and Discharge Summary Process Flow Development.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Initiated plan of correction with Nursing department and HIM to schedule weekly RN unit manager sessions to sign off or fix any outstanding nursing paperwork that is considered delinquent.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				 •	Performed discharge summary file paper audit to assure documents were present, and where all delinquent files were located. Discovered the process was different across both buildings at ESH, so process value stream and flow was assess by Quality Management and Medical Affairs to create a more efficient process. 
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Improved delinquencies decreasing them by 64%; which was done by innovating new processes and the direction and retrieval of data for employees enabling them to have better outlook on how to prioritize their job duties.
			</ul>
		  </p>
        </div>
		
		
		
		<div class="section-title">
          <h2>Treatment Team Standardization</h2>
          <p>
		  <ul>
				•	Performed treatment team audits across hospital units focusing on the NGRI population.
			</ul>	
			<ul>
				•	Utilized standardized form for audits to assess the structure, pace, tone, goals, attendance, participation, treatment needs, medication changes, collaborative decision making, and if the meeting was affecting the patient in a positive way overall.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Created Universal Audit Tool within the QAPI Database Platform to allow treatment team auditors to enter their results into a user friendly interface for data collection. In addition to the ability of the database platform to perform future audits alike.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Reported data to Executive Leadership on areas of success and which needed improvement. Enabling each clinical discipline department head to make the correct adjustments.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Resulted in treatment team structure, chemistry, and cohesiveness that greatly improved the quality of care and wellbeing of the patients attending the meetings. The hospital saw an average improvement of 37% in over 7 different main audit categories monitored.
			</ul>
		  </p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="section-title">
          <h2>Mandated Shift Decrease Endeavor</h2>
          <p>
		  <ul>
				•	Requested new data to be logged according to Nursing Mandated Shifts, Voluntary Shifts, and Call Outs to analyze and determine level of effect and severity on the hospital and its nursing staff.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Worked with Staffing Resource Department and Nursing Leadership to develop and tailor new data entry platform to report staffing shifts and help the department maintain, understand, report, and visualize all of their staffing functions. The program opened many new avenues of data that were not previously possible, creating an easy direction for nursing to handle staffing problems and irregularities.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	New data entry program was used to monitor and ultimately make the educated decision to switch from centralized staffing to on-unit staffing. Allowing individual units to manage scheduling on their own, and preventing staff from being pulled to other units inefficiently.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Once nursing staff scheduling was shifted from centralized to on-unit the hospital saw a 61% decrease in mandated shifts over a four month span, continuing to sustain positive levels throughout the following months after that. 
			</ul>
		  </p>
        </div>
		
		<div class="section-title">
          <h2>Other Notable PI Plans</h2>
          <p>
		  <ul>
		  •	Patient Aggression against Staff Severity Leveling System – Developing an addition to the QAPI database to merge both the Human Resource & Risk Management Departments in a seamless data process regarding staff injuries from patient aggression incidents.
			</ul>	
			<ul>
			    •	Clinical Student (Intern/Extern) School Affiliation – Aided in the process of creating a new intern/extern structure and policy, as well as developing an addition to the QAPI Database to merge Human Resources, Staff Training, and Purchasing Departments regarding the school contract affiliation process.
			</ul>
			<ul>
			•	Hospital Wide Intercom Code System – Developed a QAPI program to replace the paper logging system of individual hospital codes within the information center. Now all codes are logged electronically through the database platform. This allows for easy data collection for increased safety awareness at ESH.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				•	Medication Variances Reporting System – Developing an addition to the QAPI database to introduce the first medication variances logging and reporting program that the hospital has had in its history. This will greatly aid in the process of the current FMEA being implemented between Nursing, Pharmacy, and Medical Affairs Departments.
			</ul>
